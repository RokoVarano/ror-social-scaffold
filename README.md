# Scaffold for social media app with Ruby on Rails

This version includes the following features:

- Users can be created
- Users can Log in

Logged in Users:
- Users have access to the main post index
- Users have access to the 'All Users' page
- Users have access to the 'Timeline' page (Post index)
- Users have access to the 'My Friends' page

The 'All Users' page features a list of users, each with a friend request option
The 'My Friends' page features a list of friendship relationships. Clicking on a user will open that user's profile
The user profile page displays the name of the user, his posts, and his current friends.
The user profile page contains the 'Accept' and 'Reject' option for friend requests.
The 'Timeline' page displays a list of friend and own posts, ordered chronologically

This submission is for milestone 2, so mirror friendships are yet to be addressed
